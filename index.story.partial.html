    <h4>
      Scooby-Doo is an American media franchise owned by Warner Bros.
      Entertainment and created in 1969 by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears
      through their animated series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, for
      Hanna-Barbera (which was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001).
      The series features four teenagers: Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma
      Dinkley, and Shaggy Rogers, and their talking Great Dane named Scooby-Doo,
      who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a
      series of antics and missteps, while traveling using a brightly colored
      van called the "Mystery Machine".[1] The franchise has several live-action
      films and shows.
